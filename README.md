## :memo: Description

Developed a dynamic PowerApp for employees at a consultancy to manage and visualize their career progression. The app allows users to select a career map tailored to their professional growth, evaluate themselves across multiple roles within that map, and generate a radar graph visualizing their latest self-assessment. Employees can share their career progress with mentors, enabling personalized guidance and fostering professional development. The app enhances career planning, promotes self-awareness, and streamlines communication between employees and mentors, driving a culture of continuous improvement and skill development.
